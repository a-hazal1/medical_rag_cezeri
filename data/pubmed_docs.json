    "title": "Estimating the Global Burden and Health Risks Associated with Dietary and Cigarette-Related Cadmium Exposure.",
    "abstract": "To quantitatively assess the global burden and health risks associated with dietary and cigarette-related cadmium (Cd) exposure, and to provide a scientific basis for developing public health policies for the prevention and control of global Cd exposure. This study combined the Cd concentration data in foods and cigarettes and their consumption data to assess the Cd exposure levels from these two sources. The toxicity kinetics (TK) model was used to convert dietary Cd exposure into urinary Cd (U-Cd) exposure to further evaluate the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) caused by dietary Cd exposure. The risk assessment model of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) was adopted to evaluate the cancer and non-cancer risks caused by cigarette-related Cd exposure. The global average daily dietary Cd intake was 2.20 μg/kg bw/day. The daily Cd exposure to cigarettes was 0.0359 μg/kg bw/day. The proportions of the burden of CVD, stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) explained by dietary Cd intake were 6.08%, 3.34% and 2.74%, respectively. The excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) due to cigarette-related Cd exposure was 0.0037, and the non-cancer hazard quotient (NCHQ) was 26.89. Cd exposure in diet and cigarettes significantly affects the global CVD burden and cancer risk. This study emphasizes the importance of reducing Cd exposure in the environment and formulating relevant policies to mitigate health risks, including strengthening Cd control in food and implementing effective and reasonable tobacco control policies."

    "title": "From Mechanisms to Diseases: The Succinate-GPR91 Axis in Cardiometabolic Diseases.",
    "abstract": "Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) encompass a cluster of cardiovascular disorders primarily driven by metabolic dysregulation, such as obesity-associated cardiomyopathy, hypertensive heart disease, and diabetic cardiomyopathy. The pathogenesis of CMD is closely linked to chronic inflammation, myocardial hypertrophy, and mitochondrial energy metabolism dysfunction. Recently, the succinate-GPR91 pathway, a critical hub for metabolic regulation, has gained attention for its role in CMD. In addition to its function as an intermediate in the TCA cycle, succinate also exerts a range of pathophysiological effects by acting as a signaling molecule through the activation of its receptor, GPR91.Studies indicate that in metabolic disorders such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes,and atherosclerosis, abnormal activation of the succinate-GPR91 axis exacerbates inflammation, accelerates myocardial hypertrophy, and induces mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to cardiovascular damage. Targeting the succinate-GPR91 pathway may offer novel CMD therapies. This article reviews succinate's role in inflammation, hypertrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and other diseases, offering insights for CMD research and treatment."

Among primary tumors, benign tumors account for the majority, and the incidence of malignant tumors is low. In contrast, the incidence of metastatic tumors is significantly higher than that of primary tumors. The clinical features of cardiac tumors are diverse, and symptoms vary depending on the tumor type. Therefore, the diagnosis method of cardiac tumors must adopt multi-modal detection methods to ensure the accuracy of diagnosis. Treatment of cardiac tumors mainly involves surgical resection of the primary tumor to ensure complete resection. For metastatic tumors, it is crucial to consider the primary tumor when surgically resecting metastases. Depending on the characteristics of the tumor, appropriate radiation therapy or chemotherapy can improve quality of life and extend survival."

This state-of-the-art review explores the evolving concept of futility in the context of an ageing patient population and expanding armamentarium purported to treat even the most dire of cardiovascular diseases. The first objective is to delineate a framework for clinicians to elicit the different dimensions of futility, their relative importance to the patient, and their potential for improvement with the intervention being considered. Definitions are elaborated for quantitative futility-interventions with statistically negligible benefits-and qualitative futility-interventions misaligned with patient-specific goals and values. The second objective is to highlight the determinants of prohibitive risk, from the cardiovascular disease and procedural morbidity, to competing non-cardiovascular risks and frailty. A distinction is made between frailty and futility, and manifestations of severe frailty are reviewed based on the A-B-C-D-E mnemonic. The third and final objective is to discuss strategies and actionable approaches to care for patients once futility has been invoked. In addition to ongoing compassionate dialogue with the patient and family members, early initiation and aggressive pursuit of palliative care measures is beneficial for symptom control and quality of life. Ultimately, informed shared decision-making with a patient-centered philosophy is essential to uphold dignity and enhance the quality of life for older adults facing complex cardiovascular conditions."

    "abstract": "The cardiac conduction system (CCS) orchestrates the electrical impulses that enable coordinated contraction of the cardiac chambers. The T-box transcription factors <i>TBX3</i> and <i>TBX5</i> are required for CCS development and associated with overlapping and distinct human CCS diseases. We evaluated the coordinated role of <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> in the murine ventricular conduction system (VCS). We engineered a compound <i>Tbx3:Tbx5</i> conditional knockout allele for both genes located in cis on mouse chromosome 5. Conditional deletion of both T-box transcriptional factors in the VCS, using the VCS-specific <i>MinK<sup>CreERT2</sup></i>, caused loss of VCS function and molecular identity. Combined <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> deficiency in the adult VCS led to conduction defects, including prolonged PR and QRS intervals and elevated susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia. These electrophysiological defects occurred prior to detectable alterations in cardiac contractility or histologic morphology, indicative of a primary conduction system defect. <i>Tbx3:Tbx5</i> double-knockout VCS cardiomyocytes revealed a transcriptional shift toward non-CCS-specialized working myocardium, indicating a change to their cellular identity. Furthermore, optical mapping revealed a loss of VCS-specific conduction system propagation. Collectively, these findings indicate that <i>Tbx3</i> and <i>Tbx5</i> coordinate to control VCS molecular fate and function, with implications for understanding cardiac conduction disorders in humans."

    "abstract": "Biomechanical cues play an essential role in sculpting organ formation. Comprehending how cardiac cells perceive and respond to biomechanical forces is a biological process with significant medical implications that remains poorly understood. Here, we show that biomechanical forces activate endocardial <i>id2b</i> (inhibitor of DNA-binding 2b) expression, thereby promoting cardiac contractility and valve formation in zebrafish. Taking advantage of the unique strengths of zebrafish, particularly the viability of embryos lacking heartbeats, we systematically compared the transcriptomes of hearts with impaired contractility to those of control hearts. This comparison identified <i>id2b</i> as a gene sensitive to blood flow. By generating a knock-in reporter line, our results unveiled the presence of <i>id2b</i> in the endocardium, and its expression is sensitive to both pharmacological and genetic perturbations of contraction. Furthermore, <i>id2b</i> loss-of-function resulted in progressive heart malformation and early lethality. Combining RNA-seq analysis, electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and echocardiography, we discovered profound impairment in atrioventricular (AV) valve formation and defective excitation-contraction coupling in <i>id2b</i> mutants. Mechanistically, deletion of <i>id2b</i> reduced AV endocardial cell proliferation and led to a progressive increase in retrograde blood flow. In the myocardium, <i>id2b</i> directly interacted with the bHLH component <i>tcf3b</i> (transcription factor 3b) to restrict its activity. Inactivating <i>id2b</i> unleashed its inhibition on <i>tcf3b</i>, resulting in enhanced repressor activity of <i>tcf3b</i>, which subsequently suppressed the expression of <i>nrg1</i> (neuregulin 1), an essential mitogen for heart development. Overall, our findings identify <i>id2b</i> as an endocardial cell-specific, biomechanical signaling-sensitive gene, which mediates intercellular communications between endocardium and myocardium to sculpt heart morphogenesis and function."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of Testican-1 as a biomarker in feline sepsis, using pyometra as a model for naturally occurring sepsis. The study was conducted on a total of 30 cats from different breeds, aged between 1 and 8 years. The cats were divided into three groups on the basis of the owner's history, physical and gynaecological examination findings, diagnostic ultrasonography results and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. The control group (Group 1, n = 10) consisted of healthy cats without pyometra symptoms, the non-septic pyometra group (Group 2, n = 10) included cats with pyometra but not meeting the SIRS criteria, and the septic pyometra group (Group 3, n = 10) included cats with pyometra that met the SIRS criteria. The obtained data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. It was found that body temperature and pulse values were significantly higher in the non-septic and septic pyometra groups compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Respiratory rate did not show a significant difference between the control group and the non-septic pyometra group (p > 0.05), but it was significantly higher in the septic pyometra group (p < 0.001). White blood cell (WBC) counts were significantly higher in the non-septic and septic pyometra groups compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Glucose, creatinine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) values did not show significant differences between the control group and the non-septic pyometra group (p > 0.05) but were significantly higher in the septic pyometra group (p < 0.001). Serum amyloid A (SAA) and Testican-1 levels were significantly higher in both non-septic and septic pyometra groups compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between Testican-1 and heart rate (r = -0.864, p < 0.01) and creatinine (r = -0.584, p < 0.01). In contrast, significant positive correlations were found between Testican-1 and body temperature (r = 0.929, p < 0.01), respiratory rate (r = 0.844, p < 0.01), WBC (r = 0.955, p < 0.01), glucose (r = 0.865, p < 0.01), CRP (r = 0.993, p < 0.01) and SAA (r = 0.971, p < 0.01). In conclusion, it was concluded that Testican-1 could be used as a novel biomarker for the detection of sepsis in pyometra cats."

Initially designed to guide treatment decisions for patients with aortic stenosis and procedural success of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, the MDT was intended to provide a responsive mechanism to meet the needs of patients and programs. Some of the unintended consequences of guideline endorsement and regulatory requirements have diminished the perceived value and threatened the engagement of team members. To maintain its impact, the VHD MDT must evolve to reflect contemporary priorities. For patients with aortic stenosis, the concept of the MDT must expand to address the significant barriers to timely detection, diagnosis, and referral and leverage its expertise to increase program capacity to accelerate access to care. The comprehensive mitral and tricuspid valve clinical pathway is in its infancy. For this patient group, the membership of the core MDT must be strengthened by the addition of expertise to support imaging diagnostics and procedural guidance, specialty team members who can guide the individualized clinical management of complex VHD, enhanced coordination of care and patient-centered processes, and consideration of unanswered clinical concerns. A recalibrated perspective on the key principles guiding the MDT for clinicians and programs offers opportunities to make the most of lessons learned by promoting quality of care and building a VHD collective and culture that can meet patients' needs along their journey of care while prioritizing a nimble, tailored, efficient, and high-impact approach."

    "abstract": "Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process that causes calcium deposits along the mitral annulus. The pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the development of MAC are not fully understood. The main risk factors for MAC are advanced age, female gender, chronic kidney disease, and conditions predisposing to left ventricular hypertrophy, which increases mitral annulus tension and subsequent annular degeneration. The prevalence of MAC varies widely among studies, from 5% to 42%, depending on the characteristics of the study population and the imaging modality used to make the diagnosis, and it is increasing over time. MAC is independently associated with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and the occurrence of cardiovascular disease such as atrial fibrillation, conduction abnormalities, or stroke. MAC can progress and involve the mitral valve leaflets, causing mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, or both. Patients who develop symptomatic mitral valve dysfunction associated with significant MAC have lower survival when mitral valve intervention is not performed. However, the surgical risk of these patients is often high, precluding surgery in many. Therefore, transcatheter mitral valve implantation is emerging as an alternative in patients with severe MAC and associated symptomatic mitral valve dysfunction. This manuscript summarizes a description of the disease process in MAC and its treatment options."

Regarding vascular liver diseases, the term porto-sinusoidal vascular disorder is a recently redefined entity encompassing various overlapping histological patterns (<i>e.g.</i> nodular regenerative hyperplasia, obliterative portal venopathy) and clinical entities (<i>e.g.</i> idiopathic portal hypertension). These disorders have in common the absence of cirrhosis together with vascular alterations in the porto-sinusoidal region and/or feature(s) of portal hypertension. The management of portal vein thrombosis varies according to the presence or absence of cirrhosis. Anticoagulation is increasingly used in this setting and portal vein recanalisation using interventional radiology techniques is an attractive approach. Paradigms on cirrhosis-associated portal hypertension have evolved in recent years: prevention of decompensation in compensated patients has become a prime objective, non-invasive identification of patients with clinically significant portal hypertension has become possible, the concept of \"recompensation\" in decompensated patients has been proposed, and indications for TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts) have been progressively expanded. Extrahepatic vascular complications of cirrhosis include portopulmonary hypertension, hepatopulmonary syndrome, hepatorenal syndrome, and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Each of these complications poses unique challenges that affect liver disease management and transplant eligibility, underscoring the need for specialised care."

We identified 6689 participants (57.1% women) enrolled in the Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities (ARICs) study who had ≥ 3 measurements of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Cox regression models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs)-associated heart failure (HF), myocardial infarction (MI), and mortality with 1-SD increase in lipid variability captured by SD and variability independent of the mean (VIM). We also assessed whether adding lipid variability would improve the cardiovascular risk prediction beyond the conventional risk factors. Among 2130 (31.8%) obese patients, 1907 (89.5%) had obesity classes I and II and 223 (10.5%) had obesity class III. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, TC and LDL-C variabilities were significantly (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.047) associated with HF in overweight (HRs ranging from 1.10 to 1.17), obesity classes I and II (1.11-1.14), and obesity class III (1.21-1.39). Higher TC and LDL-C variabilities conferred higher risk of MI and mortality in obesity classes I and II (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.007). Adding TC-VIM and LDL-C-VIM rather than the lipid level to a conventional risk model significantly improved risk prediction of HF with net reclassification improvement amounting to 8.95% for TC-VIM (<i>p</i>=0.006) and 8.09% for LDL-C-VIM (<i>p</i>=0.012). Elevated TC and LDL-C variabilities were associated with the increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in obesity.

Its global prevalence is increasing, as shown by a marked rise in Korea from 11.4 to 56.7 per 100,000 individuals between 2010 and 2021, surpassing the incidence of tuberculosis. Among the older adult population (aged ≥65 years), the prevalence escalated from 41.9 to 163.1 per 100,000, accounting for 47.6% of cases by 2021. Treatment should be individualized based on prognostic indicators, including cavitary disease, low body mass index, and positive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli. Current therapeutic guidelines recommend a 3-drug regimen-consisting of a macrolide, rifampin, and ethambutol-administered for a minimum of 12 months following culture conversion. Nevertheless, treatment success rates are only roughly 60%, and over 30% of patients experience recurrence. This is often attributable to reinfection rather than relapse. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for clarithromycin and amikacin is essential, as resistance significantly worsens prognosis. Ethambutol plays a crucial role in preventing the development of macrolide resistance, whereas the inclusion of rifampin remains a subject of ongoing debate. Emerging therapeutic strategies suggest daily dosing for milder cases, increased azithromycin dosing, and the substitution of rifampin with clofazimine in severe presentations. Surgical resection achieves a notable sputum conversion rate of approximately 93% in eligible candidates. For refractory MAC-PD, adjunctive therapy with amikacin is advised, coupled with strategies to reduce environmental exposure. Despite advancements in therapeutic approaches, patient outcomes remain suboptimal, highlighting the urgent need for novel interventions."

    "abstract": "The early detection and accurate prediction of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are critical to reduce global severe morbidity and mortality. Machine learning (ML) methods, operated by Transformers have proved its efficiency in interpreting complex data interactions. One prime example would be its notable success in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with its multi-headed self-attention mechanism to disentangle the complex interactions within high-dimensional spaces. However, the relationships between various features within biological systems remain ambiguous in these spaces, making it difficult to apply transformers in clinical datasets. We introduce CardioTabNet, a transformer-driven framework designed precisely for clinical cardiovascular data. It leverages the strength of the tab transformer architecture to effectively extract meaningful insights from clinical data. As a result, downstream classical models' performance significantly showed outstanding results. We utilized an open-source cardiovascular dataset with 1190 instances and 11 features. These features are categorized into numerical (age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, maximum heart rate, old peak, weight, and fasting blood sugar) and categorical (resting Electrocardiograms, exercise angina, and ST slope) variables. Tab transformer was used to extract significant features and rank them using a Random Forest (RF) feature ranking algorithm which highlighted the important clinical predictors. We used ten classical machine-learning models trained on these transformer extracted-features. An optimized ExtraTree classifier achieved an average accuracy of 94.1% and area under curve (AUC) of 95%. Furthermore, we performed nomogram analysis to draw out cardiovascular risk assessment to demonstrate clinical interpretability. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methodologies affirmed the superior predictive capability of our CardioTabNet framework, demonstrating its potential as a robust tool for clinical decision support in cardiovascular disease prediction and early detection. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis was carried out to provide insights into feature contributions and enhance model interpretability."

This study aimed to evaluate LLMs' applications in CVD and explore their current implementation, from prevention to treatment. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, this systematic review assessed LLM applications in CVD. A comprehensive PubMed search identified relevant studies. The review prioritized pragmatic and practical applications of LLMs. Key applications, benefits, and limitations of LLMs in CVD prevention were summarized. Thirty-five observational studies met the eligibility criteria. Of these, 54% addressed primary prevention and risk factor management, while 46% focused on established CVD. Commercial LLMs were evaluated in all but one study, with 91% (32 studies) assessing ChatGPT. The LLM applications were categorized as follows: 72% addressed patient education, 17% clinical decision support, and 11% both. In 68% of studies, the primary objective was to evaluate LLMs' performance in answering frequently asked patient questions, with results indicating accurate, comprehensive, and generally safe responses. However, occasional misinformation and hallucinated references were noted. Additional applications included patient guidance on CVD, first aid, and lifestyle recommendations. Large language models were assessed for medical questions, diagnostic support, and treatment recommendations in clinical decision support. Large language models hold significant potential in CVD prevention and treatment. Evidence supports their potential as an alternative source of information for addressing patients' questions about common CVD. However, further validation is needed for their application in individualized care, from diagnosis to treatment."

Foundation models provide an efficient starting point for deep learning that can facilitate effective DNN training with fewer labelled training examples. In this study, we leveraged cardiologist-confirmed labels from a large dataset of 1.6 million electrocardiograms (ECGs) acquired as part of routine clinical care at UCSF between 1986 and 2019 to pre-train a convolutional DNN to predict 68 common ECG diagnoses. To our knowledge, this model is one of the most comprehensive ECG DNN models to date, demonstrating high performance with a median area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.978, median sensitivity of 0.937, and median specificity of 0.923. We then demonstrate the model's utility as a foundation model by additionally training (fine-tuning) the DNN to detect three novel ECG diagnoses with relatively small datasets: carcinoid syndrome, pericardial constriction, and rheumatic doming of the mitral valve. Fine-tuning training of the foundation model achieved an AUC of 0.772 (95% CI 0.723-0.816) for carcinoid syndrome, 0.883 (0.863-0.906) for pericardial constriction, and 0.826 (95% CI 0.802-0.854) for rheumatic doming, compared to 0.492 (95% CI 0.434-0.558), 0.689 (95% CI 0.656-0.720), and 0.701 (95% CI 0.657-0.745), respectively, for DNNs trained from scratch on the same small datasets.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile PCSK9 inhibition has proven safe and effective, there is limited research on using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to assess the impact of atorvastatin combined with PCSK9 inhibitors on borderline coronary lesions.MethodsFrom June 2022 to June 2025, a detailed analysis of biochemical markers, coronary angiography (CAG), and IVUS was conducted on 69 patients with borderline coronary lesions after different treatments.ResultsOf the 69 patients enrolled, 60 completed the 48-week study. All groups showed significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions, with Group C (Alirocumab + Atorvastatin) having the largest decrease from 3.64 to 1.48 (<i>P</i> < .001). At 48 weeks, arterial lumen volumes increased in all groups, but Group C's was significantly larger than Groups A (Alirocumab + placebo) and B (Atorvastatin + placebo) (<i>P</i> = .038). Group C also had a greater reduction in plaque volume compared to Groups A and B (<i>P</i> = .041).ConclusionAlirocumab and Atorvastatin together significantly lowered LDL-C levels and improved the vascular environment, notably reversing plaque in patients with borderline coronary lesions."

    "abstract": "Recently, Acurate neo2 (ACN2; Boston Scientific, US) and Sapien-3 series (Edwards Lifesciences, US) were compared in the IDE trial failing to demonstrate non-inferiority of ACN2. The Myval series (MyV), an alternative balloon-expandable device, demonstrated non-inferiority compared to Sapien-3 and Evolut (Medtronic, US) in the LANDMARK trial. However, no direct comparison exists between ACN2 and MyV."

    "abstract": "An increasing number of women with congenital heart disease reach childbearing age. These women have a higher occurrence of cardiac events, such as heart failure and arrhythmia, than women without congenital heart disease. We aimed to illuminate women's experiences in connection with pregnancy and how they understand and manage signs and symptoms in relation to their heart defects."

    "title": "Benchmarking of computational demultiplexing methods for single-nucleus RNA sequencing data.",
    "abstract": "Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) has transformed our understanding of complex tissues, providing insights into cellular composition and heterogeneity in gene expression between cells, and their alterations in development and disease. High costs however constrain the number of samples analysed. Sample pooling and their demultiplexing following sequencing based on prior labelling with antibodies or lipid anchors conjugated to DNA barcodes (cell hashing and MULTI-seq), or using genetic differences between samples, provides a solution. However, there remains no comprehensive evaluation of these demultiplexing tools to guide selection between them. Here, we benchmark the leading software (Vireo, Souporcell, Freemuxlet, scSplit) used for sample demultiplexing using genetic variants. We further compared obtaining genetic variants from SNP array analysis of gDNA and from sample-matched bulk-RNA-Seq data, identified using three different variant calling tools (BCFtools, cellSNP, FreeBayes). Demultiplexing performance was evaluated on simulated multiplexed datasets comprising two, four, and six samples with doublet percentages between 0% and 30%, and validated against demultiplexing using sex-linked genes. Software implementation and execution were evaluated by run speed, robustness, scalability, and usability. Our results show that all tools excluding scSplit provide high recall and precision with an accuracy of 80%-85%. Vireo achieved the best accuracy. Demultiplexing tools were differentially affected by the variant calling tool with which it was paired. For all tools, accuracy decreased with the increasing percentage of doublets. Deployment of demultiplexing during analysis of pooled real-world 10x RNA-Seq data from the human heart and from different species is shown, as are advantages for doublet detection and removal."

    "abstract": "The risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) is increased in type 1 diabetes, due to accelerated atherosclerosis. The molecular mechanisms are yet to be unraveled, but potential functional and quantitative abnormalities in lipoproteins are suggested to be involved. Some individuals have coronary arteries free from atherosclerosis even after living with type 1 diabetes for many decades. We therefore aimed to investigate the associations between a set of lipoproteins and metabolites and the presence of coronary arteries free from atherosclerosis in individuals with long-term type 1 diabetes."

It poses significant challenges in treatment, leading to poor long-term prognosis and substantial economic burden on patients' families. This study, based on a 10-year multi-center real-world investigation, identified that hyperhomocysteinemia and hypohemoglobinemia in myocardial infarction (MI) patients are associated with an increased risk of developing CRS. Consequently, we integrated these two factors into a machine learning model to evaluate its diagnostic and prognostic value for CRS, providing novel insights for clinical and nursing practices."
