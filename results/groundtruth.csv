Many people don't have symptoms, but some people have cramping, bloating, and constipation. Some people also have bleeding, inflammation, and fistulas. If you are bleeding, bright red blood will pass through your rectum. The rectum is the end of the colon that connects to the anus. The rectum and anus are part of the gastrointestinal tract, which is the passage that food goes through. Rectal bleeding is usually painless, but it can be dangerous. You should see a doctor right away. Diverticulitis. People with diverticulitis can have many symptoms. Often pain is felt in the lower part of the abdomen. If you have diverticulitis, you may have fevers, feel sick to your stomach, vomit, or have a change in your bowel habits."
Who is at risk for What I need to know about Diverticular Disease? ?,"Many people get diverticular disease. Starting at age 40, the chance of getting it increases about every 10 years. About half of people between the ages of 60 and 80 have diverticular disease. Almost everyone over 80 has it."
What are the treatments for What I need to know about Diverticular Disease ?,"Treatment for diverticular disease depends on how serious the problem is and whether you are suffering from diverticulosis or diverticulitis. Most people get better by changing their diet. If you have rectal bleeding, you need to go to the hospital so a doctor can find the part of your colon that is bleeding. The doctor may use a special drug that makes the bleeding stop. The doctor may also decide to operate and remove the part of the colon that is bleeding."
What are the treatments for What I need to know about Diverticular Disease ?,Eating high-fiber foods can help relieve symptoms. Sometimes mild pain medications also help.
What is (are) Kidney Failure: Choosing a Treatment That's Right for You ?,"The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They are located just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the two kidneys filter about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine, composed of wastes and extra fluid. The urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through two thin tubes of muscle called ureters, one on each side of the bladder. The bladder stores urine. The muscles of the bladder wall remain relaxed while the bladder fills with urine. As the bladder fills to capacity, signals sent to the brain tell a person to find a toilet soon. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra, located at the bottom of the bladder. In men the urethra is long, while in women it is short."
What is (are) Kidney Failure: Choosing a Treatment That's Right for You ?,"Chronic kidney disease means you have damaged kidneys that cannot filter blood normally. Wastes then build up in your blood, harming your body. Kidney disease usually does not get better and may lead to kidney failure. If your kidneys fail, current treatment options can help you live a longer, healthier life. Some people live with kidney disease for years without needing treatment. Others progress quickly to kidney failure."
What is (are) Hyperthyroidism ?,"Hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs. Hyperthyroidism is sometimes called thyrotoxicosis, the technical term for too much thyroid hormone in the blood. Thyroid hormones circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream and act on virtually every tissue and cell in the body. Hyperthyroidism causes many of the bodys functions to speed up. About 1 percent of the U.S. population has hyperthyroidism.1"
What is (are) Urinary Retention ?,"Urinary retention is the inability to empty the bladder completely. Urinary retention can be acute or chronic. Acute urinary retention happens suddenly and lasts only a short time. People with acute urinary retention cannot urinate at all, even though they have a full bladder. Acute urinary retention, a potentially life-threatening medical condition, requires immediate emergency treatment. Acute urinary retention can cause great discomfort or pain. Chronic urinary retention can be a long-lasting medical condition. People with chronic urinary retention can urinate. However, they do not completely empty all of the urine from their bladders. Often people are not even aware they have this condition until they develop another problem, such as urinary incontinenceloss of bladder control, resulting in the accidental loss of urineor a urinary tract infection (UTI), an illness caused by harmful bacteria growing in the urinary tract."
What is (are) Alagille Syndrome ?,"Alagille syndrome is a genetic condition that results in various symptoms in different parts of the body, including the liver. A person with Alagille syndrome has fewer than the normal number of small bile ducts inside the liver. The liver is the organ in the abdomenthe area between the chest and hipsthat makes blood proteins and bile, stores energy and nutrients, fights infection, and removes harmful chemicals from the blood.
What is (are) Alagille Syndrome ?,"The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tractalso called the digestive tractand the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. The hollow organs that make up the GI tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestinewhich includes the colon and rectumand anus. Food enters the mouth and passes to the anus through the hollow organs of the digestive system. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are the solid organs of the digestive system. The digestive system helps the body digest food."
causes,What causes Alagille Syndrome ?,"Alagille syndrome is caused by a gene mutation, or defect. Genes provide instructions for making proteins in the body. A gene mutation is a permanent change in the DNA sequence that makes up a gene. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the material inside cells that carries genetic information and passes genes from parent to child. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with Alagille syndrome have an inherited gene mutation, meaning it has been passed on by a parent. In the remaining cases, the gene mutation develops spontaneously.1 In spontaneous cases, neither parent carries a copy of the mutated gene.
What is (are) Prevent diabetes problems: Keep your heart and blood vessels healthy ?,"Too much glucose in the blood for a long time can cause diabetes problems. This high blood glucose, also called blood sugar, can damage many parts of the body, such as the heart, blood vessels, eyes, and kidneys. Heart and blood vessel disease can lead to heart attacks and strokes, the leading causes of death for people with diabetes. You can do a lot to prevent or slow down diabetes problems.
What is (are) Primary Hyperparathyroidism ?,"Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder of the parathyroid glands, also called parathyroids. Primary means this disorder originates in the parathyroid glands. In primary hyperparathyroidism, one or more of the parathyroid glands are overactive. As a result, the gland releases too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). The disorder includes the problems that occur in the rest of the body as a result of too much PTHfor example, loss of calcium from bones.
What is (are) HIV/AIDS and Infections ?,"Having HIV/AIDS weakens your body's immune system. Your immune system normally fights germs that enter your body. When HIV/AIDS makes it weak, it can't fight germs well. This can lead to serious infections that don't often affect healthy people. These are called opportunistic infections (OIs).    There are many types of OIs. Tuberculosis and a serious related disease, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are bacterial infections. Viral infections include cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis C. Fungi cause thrush (candidiasis), cryptococcal meningitis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and histoplasmosis, and parasites cause crypto (cryptosporidiosis) and toxo (toxoplasmosis).    Having HIV/AIDS can make any infection harder to treat. People with AIDS are also more likely to suffer complications of common illnesses such as the flu.     The good news is that you can help prevent infections by taking your HIV/AIDS medicines. Other things that can help include practicing safe sex, washing your hands well and often and cooking your food well."
Do you have information about Baby Health Checkup,"There are many new responsibilities when you have a baby. One of them is to make sure they get the checkups that they need. Well-baby exams are important in making sure that your baby is growing and developing properly. If there are problems, you can catch them early. This means that there is a better chance for treatment.    During these checkups, your baby will get any needed immunizations and screenings. This is also a good chance to ask your health care provider any questions about how to care for your baby."
What is (are) Mitral Valve Prolapse ?,"Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) occurs when one of your heart's valves doesn't work properly. The flaps of the valve are ""floppy"" and don't close tightly. Most people who have the condition are born with it. It also tends to run in families.    Most of the time, MVP doesn't cause any problems. Rarely, blood can leak the wrong way through the floppy valve. This can cause       - Palpitations (feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, or beating too hard or too fast)    - Shortness of breath    - Cough    - Fatigue, dizziness, or anxiety    - Migraine headaches    - Chest discomfort       Most people who have mitral valve prolapse (MVP) don't need treatment because they don't have symptoms and complications. If you need treatment for MVP, medicines can help relieve symptoms or prevent complications. Very few people will need surgery to repair or replace the mitral valve.    MVP puts you at risk for infective endocarditis, a kind of heart infection. To prevent it, doctors used to prescribe antibiotics before dental work or certain surgeries. Now, only people at high risk of endocarditis need the antibiotics.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
What is (are) Knee Injuries and Disorders ?,"Your knee joint is made up of bone, cartilage, ligaments and fluid. Muscles and tendons help the knee joint move. When any of these structures is hurt or diseased, you have knee problems. Knee problems can cause pain and difficulty walking.    Knee problems are very common, and they occur in people of all ages. Knee problems can interfere with many things, from participation in sports to simply getting up from a chair and walking. This can have a big impact on your life.    The most common disease affecting the knee is osteoarthritis. The cartilage in the knee gradually wears away, causing pain and swelling.    Injuries to ligaments and tendons also cause knee problems. A common injury is to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). You usually injure your ACL by a sudden twisting motion. ACL and other knee injuries are common sports injuries.    Treatment of knee problems depends on the cause. In some cases your doctor may recommend knee replacement.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"
"What is (are) Poison Ivy, Oak and Sumac ?","If you spend time outdoors, chances are you have been bothered by poison ivy, poison oak or poison sumac at some point. Most people are sensitive to the plants' oily sap. The sap is in the root, stems, leaves and fruit of these plants. If it gets on your skin, it causes a blistering skin rash. The rash can range from mild to severe, depending on how much sap gets on your skin and how sensitive you are to it. Problems can also happen if the plants are burned. Airborne sap-coated soot can get into the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory system.     The best way to avoid the rash is to learn what the plants look like and stay away from them. If you come into contact with the plants, wash your skin and clothing right away. If you develop a rash, ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter medicines. For severe rashes, see your doctor.     National Park Service"
What is (are) After Surgery ?,"After any operation, you'll have some side effects. There is usually some pain with surgery. There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the surgeon cut. Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect.    There can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the operation. Some complications are infection, too much bleeding, reaction to anesthesia, or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions.    Your surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are       - How long you will be in the hospital    - What kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go home    - When you can go back to work    - When it is ok to start exercising again    - Are they any other restrictions in your activities       Following your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.    Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research"
What is (are) Pheochromocytoma ?,"Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that usually starts in the cells of one of your adrenal glands. Although they are usually benign, pheochromocytomas often cause the adrenal gland to make too many hormones. This can lead to high blood pressure and cause symptoms such as        - Headaches    - Sweating    - Pounding of the heart    - Being shaky    - Being extremely pale       Sometimes pheochromocytoma is part of another condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome (MEN). People with MEN often have other cancers and other problems involving hormones.     Doctors use lab tests and imaging tests to diagnose it. Surgery is the most common treatment. Other options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses substances that attack cancer cells without harming normal cells.    NIH: National Cancer Institute"
Do you have information about Secondhand Smoke,"Secondhand smoke is a mixture of the smoke that comes from the burning end of a cigarette, cigar, or pipe, and the smoke breathed out by the smoker. It contains more than 7,000 chemicals. Hundreds of those chemicals are toxic and about 70 can cause cancer.    Health effects of secondhand smoke include       - Ear infections in children    - More frequent and severe asthma attacks in children    - Heart disease and lung cancer in adults who have never smoked       There is no safe amount of secondhand smoke. Even low levels of it can be harmful. The only way to fully protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke is not to allow smoking indoors.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
Do you have information about Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage,"Part D is the name of Medicare's prescription drug coverage. It's insurance that helps people pay for prescription drugs. It is available to everyone who has Medicare. It provides protection if you pay high drug costs or have unexpected prescription drug bills. It doesn't cover all costs. You have to pay part of the cost of prescription drugs. Most people also have to pay an additional monthly cost.    Private companies provide Medicare prescription drug coverage. You choose the drug plan you like best. Whether or not you should sign up depends on how good your current coverage is. You need to sign up as soon as you are eligible for Medicare. Otherwise, there may be additional charges.    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services"
What is (are) Rotator Cuff Injuries ?,"Your rotator cuff is located in your shoulder area. It is made of muscles and tendons. It helps your shoulder to move and stay stable. Problems with the rotator cuff are common. They include tendinitis, bursitis, and injuries such as tears.    Rotator cuff tendons can become inflamed from frequent use or aging. Sometimes they are injured from a fall on an outstretched hand. Sports or jobs with repeated overhead motion can also damage the rotator cuff. Aging causes tendons to wear down, which can lead to a tear.     Some tears are not painful, but others can be very painful. Treatment for a torn rotator cuff depends on age, health, how severe the injury is, and how long you've had the torn rotator cuff.     Treatment for torn rotator cuff includes:       - Rest    - Heat or cold to the sore area    - Medicines that reduce pain and swelling    - Electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves    - Ultrasound    - Cortisone injection    - Surgery       NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease"
What is (are) Helicobacter Pylori Infections ?,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria that causes infection in the stomach. It is found in about two-thirds of the world's population. It may be spread by unclean food and water, but researchers aren't sure. It causes Peptic ulcers and can also cause stomach cancer.    If you have symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your doctor will test your blood, breath or stool to see if it contains H. pylori. The best treatment is a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medicines. You will need to be tested after treatment to make sure the infection is gone.    To help prevent an H. pylori infection, you should       - Wash your hands after using the bathroom and before eating    - Eat properly prepared food    - Drink water from a clean, safe source       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
What is (are) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ?,"Is it hard for your child to sit still? Does your child act without thinking first? Does your child start but not finish things? If so, your child may have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Nearly everyone shows some of these behaviors at times, but ADHD lasts more than 6 months and causes problems in school, at home and in social situations.    ADHD is more common in boys than girls. It affects 3-5 percent of all American children.    The main features of ADHD are       - Inattention    - Hyperactivity    - Impulsivity       No one knows exactly what causes ADHD. It sometimes runs in families, so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.    A complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has ADHD. Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms, therapy, or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health"
Do you have information about Diets,"Your diet is made up of what you eat. A healthy diet        - May include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products    - May include lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, eggs and nuts    - Goes easy on saturated fats, trans fat, cholesterol, salt (sodium), and added sugars       There are many different types of diets. Some, like a vegetarian diet, don't include meats. Others, like the Mediterranean diet, describe a traditional way of eating of a specific region. And there are diets for people with certain health problems, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.    Many people follow specific diets to lose weight. Some of these diets are fad or crash diets that severely restrict calories or the types of food you are allowed to eat. These diets rarely lead to permanent weight loss and often don't provide all of the nutrients your body needs. To lose weight, you need to use more calories than you eat. Portion control is the key. When trying to lose weight, you can still eat your favorite foods -- as long as you pay attention to the total number of calories that you eat.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
What is (are) Peptic Ulcer ?,"A peptic ulcer is a sore in the lining of your stomach or your duodenum, the first part of your small intestine. A burning stomach pain is the most common symptom. The pain       - Starts between meals or during the night    - Briefly stops if you eat or take antacids    - Lasts for minutes to hours    - Comes and goes for several days or weeks       Peptic ulcers happen when the acids that help you digest food damage the walls of the stomach or duodenum. The most common cause is infection with a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. Another cause is the long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Stress and spicy foods do not cause ulcers, but can make them worse.     To see if you have an H. pylori infection, your doctor will test your blood, breath, or stool. Your doctor also may look inside your stomach and duodenum by doing an endoscopy or x-ray.    Peptic ulcers will get worse if not treated. Treatment may include medicines to reduce stomach acids or antibiotics to kill H. pylori. Antacids and milk can't heal peptic ulcers. Not smoking and avoiding alcohol can help. You may need surgery if your ulcers don't heal.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
Do you have information about Ebola,"Ebola hemorrhagic fever is caused by a virus. It is a severe and often fatal disease. It can affect humans and other primates. Researchers believe that the virus first spreads from an infected animal to a human. It can then spread from human to human through direct contact with a patient's blood or secretions.    Symptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms usually include       - Fever    - Headache    - Joint and muscle aches    - Weakness    - Diarrhea    - Vomiting    - Stomach pain    - Lack of appetite       Other symptoms including rash, red eyes, and internal and external bleeding, may also occur.    The early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other, more common, diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. However, if a person has the early symptoms of Ebola and there is reason to suspect Ebola, the patient should be isolated. It is also important to notify public health professionals. Lab tests can confirm whether the patient has Ebola.    There is no cure for Ebola. Treatment involves supportive care such as fluids, oxygen, and treatment of complications. Some people who get Ebola are able to recover, but many do not.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
Do you have information about Medicines,"You may need to take medicines every day, or only once in a while. Either way, you want to make sure that the medicines are safe and will help you get better. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is in charge of assuring the safety and effectiveness of both prescription and over-the-counter medicines.    Even safe drugs can cause unwanted side effects or interactions with food or other medicines you may be taking. They may not be safe during pregnancy. To reduce the risk of reactions and make sure that you get better, it is important for you to take your medicines correctly and be careful when giving medicines to children."
What is (are) Prader-Willi Syndrome ?,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder. It causes poor muscle tone, low levels of sex hormones and a constant feeling of hunger. The part of the brain that controls feelings of fullness or hunger does not work properly in people with PWS. They overeat, leading to obesity.    Babies with PWS are usually floppy, with poor muscle tone, and have trouble sucking. Boys may have undescended testicles. Later, other signs appear. These include       - Short stature    - Poor motor skills    - Weight gain     - Underdeveloped sex organs    - Mild intellectual and learning disabilities       There is no cure for PWS. Growth hormone, exercise, and dietary supervision can help build muscle mass and control weight. Other treatments may include sex hormones and behavior therapy. Most people with PWS will need specialized care and supervision throughout their lives.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"
Do you have information about Drinking Water,"We all need to drink water. How much you need depends on your size, activity level, and the weather where you live.    The water you drink is a combination of surface water and groundwater. Surface water includes rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Groundwater comes from underground. The United States has one of the safest water supplies in the world, but drinking water quality can vary from place to place. It depends on the condition of the source water and the treatment it receives. Treatment may include adding fluoride to prevent cavities and chlorine to kill germs.     Your water supplier must give you annual reports on drinking water. The reports include where your water came from and what contaminants are in it.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Autoimmune Diseases ?,"Your body's immune system protects you from disease and infection. But if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake. Autoimmune diseases can affect many parts of the body.    No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. They do tend to run in families. Women - particularly African-American, Hispanic-American, and Native-American women - have a higher risk for some autoimmune diseases.    There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases, and some have similar symptoms. This makes it hard for your health care provider to know if you really have one of these diseases, and if so, which one. Getting a diagnosis can be frustrating and stressful. Often, the first symptoms are fatigue, muscle aches and a low fever. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain and swelling.    The diseases may also have flare-ups, when they get worse, and remissions, when symptoms get better or disappear. Treatment depends on the disease, but in most cases one important goal is to reduce inflammation. Sometimes doctors prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs that reduce your immune response."
What is (are) Infections and Pregnancy ?,"If you are pregnant, an infection can be more than just a problem for you. Some infections can be dangerous to your baby. You can help yourself avoid infections:       - Don't eat raw or undercooked meat    - Don't share food or drinks with other people    - Wash your hands frequently    - Don't empty cat litter. Cats can transmit toxoplasmosis.       You may need to take medicines or get a vaccine to prevent an infection in your baby. For example, you may need to take antibiotics if you develop an infection with group B strep, or take medicines if you have genital herpes. Only some medicines and vaccines are safe during pregnancy. Ask your health care provider about how best to protect you and your baby."
What is (are) Coping with Chronic Illness ?,"Having a long-term, or chronic, illness can disrupt your life in many ways. You may often be tired and in pain. Your illness might affect your appearance or your physical abilities and independence. You may not be able to work, causing financial problems. For children, chronic illnesses can be frightening, because they may not understand why this is happening to them.    These changes can cause stress, anxiety and anger. If they do, it is important to seek help. A trained counselor can help you develop strategies to regain a feeling of control. Support groups might help, too. You will find that you are not alone, and you may learn some new tips on how to cope."
What is (are) Endocarditis ?,"Endocarditis, also called infective endocarditis (IE), is an inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. The most common type, bacterial endocarditis, occurs when germs enter your heart. These germs come through your bloodstream from another part of your body, often your mouth. Bacterial endocarditis can damage your heart valves. If untreated, it can be life-threatening. It is rare in healthy hearts.     Risk factors include having       - An abnormal or damaged heart valve     - An artificial heart valve     - Congenital heart defects       The signs and symptoms of IE can vary from person to person. They also can vary over time in the same person. Symptoms you might notice include fever, shortness of breath, fluid buildup in your arms or legs, tiny red spots on your skin, and weight loss. Your doctor will diagnose IE based on your risk factors, medical history, signs and symptoms, and lab and heart tests.    Early treatment can help you avoid complications. Treatment usually involves high-dose antibiotics. If your heart valve is damaged, you may need surgery.    If you're at risk for IE, brush and floss your teeth regularly, and have regular dental checkups. Germs from a gum infection can enter your bloodstream. If you are at high risk, your doctor might prescribe antibiotics before dental work and certain types of surgery.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
What is (are) Guillain-Barre Syndrome ?,"Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection, surgery, or a vaccination.     The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases, you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks and then stabilize.     Guillain-Barre can be hard to diagnose. Possible tests include nerve tests and a spinal tap. Most people recover. Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. Treatment can help symptoms, and may include medicines or a procedure called plasma exchange.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"
What is (are) Gum Disease ?,"If you have gum disease, you're not alone. Many U.S. adults currently have some form of the disease. It ranges from simple gum inflammation, called gingivitis, to serious damage to the tissue and bone supporting the teeth. In the worst cases, you can lose teeth.    In gingivitis, the gums become red and swollen. They can bleed easily. Gingivitis is a mild form of gum disease. You can usually reverse it with daily brushing and flossing and regular cleanings by a dentist or dental hygienist. Untreated gingivitis can lead to periodontitis. If you have periodontitis, the gums pull away from the teeth and form pockets that become infected. If not treated, the bones, gums and connective tissue that support the teeth are destroyed.    NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research"
What is (are) Pregnancy and Substance Abuse ?,"When you are pregnant, you are not just ""eating for two."" You also breathe and drink for two, so it is important to carefully consider what you give to your baby. If you smoke, use alcohol or take illegal drugs, so does your unborn baby.    First, don't smoke. Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine and cancer-causing drugs to your baby. Smoke also keeps your baby from getting nourishment and raises the risk of stillbirth or premature birth. Don't drink alcohol. There is no known safe amount of alcohol a woman can drink while pregnant. Alcohol can cause life-long physical and behavioral problems in children, including fetal alcohol syndrome. Don't use illegal drugs. Using illegal drugs may cause underweight babies, birth defects or withdrawal symptoms after birth.    If you are pregnant and you smoke, drink alcohol or do drugs, get help. Your health care provider can recommend programs to help you quit. You and your baby will be better off.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health"
Do you have information about Evaluating Health Information,"Millions of consumers get health information from magazines, TV or the Internet. Some of the information is reliable and up to date; some is not. How can you tell the good from the bad?    First, consider the source. If you use the Web, look for an ""about us"" page. Check to see who runs the site: Is it a branch of the government, a university, a health organization, a hospital or a business? Focus on quality. Does the site have an editorial board? Is the information reviewed before it is posted? Be skeptical. Things that sound too good to be true often are. You want current, unbiased information based on research.    NIH: National Library of Medicine"
What is (are) Degenerative Nerve Diseases ?,"Degenerative nerve diseases affect many of your body's activities, such as balance, movement, talking, breathing, and heart function. Many of these diseases are genetic. Sometimes the cause is a medical condition such as alcoholism, a tumor, or a stroke. Other causes may include toxins, chemicals, and viruses. Sometimes the cause is not known.    Degenerative nerve diseases include       -  Alzheimer's disease    -  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis    - Friedreich's ataxia    -  Huntington's disease    -  Lewy body disease    - Parkinson's disease     -  Spinal muscular atrophy       Degenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms, relieve pain, and increase mobility."
Do you have information about Native American Health,"Every racial or ethnic group has specific health concerns. Differences in the health of groups can result from:       - Genetics    - Environmental factors    - Access to care    - Cultural factors        On this page, you'll find links to health issues that affect Native Americans."
What is (are) Gluten Sensitivity ?,"Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be in other products like medicines, vitamins, and supplements. People with gluten sensitivity have problems with gluten. It is different from celiac disease, an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten because it will damage their small intestine.    Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease. They include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms too, including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease.    Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity. If your health care provider thinks you have it, he or she may suggest that you stop eating gluten to see if your symptoms go away. However, you should first be tested to rule out celiac disease.

What is (are) Head Lice ?,"Head lice are parasitic wingless insects. They live on people's heads and feed on their blood. An adult louse is about the size of a sesame seed. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a knot in thread. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.    Lice spread by close person-to-person contact. It is possible, but not common, to get lice by sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. Personal hygiene has nothing to do with getting head lice. Head lice do not spread disease.    Symptoms are        - Tickling feeling in the hair    - Frequent itching    - Sores from scratching    - Irritability and difficulty sleeping. Head lice are most active in the dark.       Treatment is recommended for people who have an active infestation of head lice. All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. Some experts also recommend treating anyone who shares a bed with an infested person. It is important to treat everyone at the same time.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Prediabetes ?,"Prediabetes means you have blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.    Most people with prediabetes don't have any symptoms. Your doctor can use an A1C test or another blood test to find out if your blood glucose levels are higher than normal. If you are 45 years old or older, your doctor may recommend that you be tested for prediabetes, especially if you are overweight.    Losing weight - at least 5 to 10 percent of your starting weight - can prevent or delay diabetes or even reverse prediabetes. That's 10 to 20 pounds for someone who weighs 200 pounds. You can lose weight by cutting down on the amount of calories and fat you eat and being physically active at least 30 minutes a day. Being physically active makes your body's insulin work better. Your doctor may also prescribe medicine to help control the amount of glucose in your blood.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
What is (are) Voice Disorders ?,"Voice is the sound made by air passing from your lungs through your larynx, or voice box. In your larynx are your vocal cords, two bands of muscle that vibrate to make sound. For most of us, our voices play a big part in who we are, what we do, and how we communicate. Like fingerprints, each person's voice is unique.    Many things we do can injure our vocal cords. Talking too much, screaming, constantly clearing your throat, or smoking can make you hoarse. They can also lead to problems such as nodules, polyps, and sores on the vocal cords. Other causes of voice disorders include infections, upward movement of stomach acids into the throat, growths due to a virus, cancer, and diseases that paralyze the vocal cords.    Signs that your voice isn't healthy include       - Your voice has become hoarse or raspy    - You've lost the ability to hit some high notes when singing    - Your voice suddenly sounds deeper    - Your throat often feels raw, achy, or strained    - It's become an effort to talk       Treatment for voice disorders varies depending on the cause. Most voice problems can be successfully treated when diagnosed early.    NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders"
Do you have information about Eye Wear,"Eye wear protects or corrects your vision. Examples are       - Sunglasses    - Safety goggles    - Glasses (also called eyeglasses)    - Contact lenses       If you need corrective lenses, you may be able to choose between contacts or glasses. Either usually requires a prescription. Almost anyone can wear glasses. Contact lenses require more careful handling.     Many jobs and some sports carry a risk of eye injury. Thousands of children and adults get eye injuries every year. Most are preventable with proper eye protection. Everyone is at risk for eye damage from the sun year-round. It's important to regularly use sunglasses that block out at least 99 percent of UV rays."
What is (are) Bile Duct Diseases ?,"Your liver makes a digestive juice called bile. Your gallbladder stores it between meals. When you eat, your gallbladder pushes the bile into tubes called bile ducts. They carry the bile to your small intestine. The bile helps break down fat. It also helps the liver get rid of toxins and wastes.    Different diseases can block the bile ducts and cause a problem with the flow of bile:       - Gallstones, which can increase pressure in the gallbladder and cause a gallbladder attack. The pain usually lasts from one to several hours.    - Cancer    - Infections    - Birth defects, such as biliary atresia. It is the most common reason for liver transplants in children in the United States.    - Inflammation, which can cause scarring. Over time, this can lead to liver failure.       NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
What is (are) Testicular Disorders ?,"Testicles, or testes, make male hormones and sperm. They are two egg-shaped organs inside the scrotum, the loose sac of skin behind the penis. It's easy to injure your testicles because they are not protected by bones or muscles. Men and boys should wear athletic supporters when they play sports.     You should examine your testicles monthly and seek medical attention for lumps, redness, pain or other changes. Testicles can get inflamed or infected. They can also develop cancer. Testicular cancer is rare and highly treatable. It usually happens between the ages of 15 and 40."
What is (are) Scabies ?,"Scabies is an itchy skin condition caused by the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabei. It is common all over the world, and can affect anyone. Scabies spreads quickly in crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people. Hospitals, child-care centers, and nursing homes are examples. Scabies can easily infect sex partners and other household members. Sharing clothes, towels, and bedding can sometimes spread scabies. This can happen much more easily when the infested person has crusted scabies. You cannot get scabies from a pet. Pets get a different mite infection called mange.     Symptoms are       - Pimple-like irritations or a rash     - Intense itching, especially at night    - Sores caused by scratching        Your health care provider diagnoses scabies by looking at the skin rash and finding burrows in the skin.    Several lotions are available to treat scabies. The infected person's clothes, bedding and towels should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. Treatment is also recommended for household members and sexual partners.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Genetic Brain Disorders ?,"A genetic brain disorder is caused by a variation or a mutation in a gene. A variation is a different form of a gene. A mutation is a change in a gene. Genetic brain disorders affect the development and function of the brain.    Some genetic brain disorders are due to random gene mutations or mutations caused by environmental exposure, such as cigarette smoke. Other disorders are inherited, which means that a mutated gene or group of genes is passed down through a family. They can also be due to a combination of both genetic changes and other outside factors.    Some examples of genetic brain disorders include       - Leukodystrophies    - Phenylketonuria    - Tay-Sachs disease    - Wilson disease       Many people with genetic brain disorders fail to produce enough of certain proteins that influence brain development and function. These brain disorders can cause serious problems that affect the nervous system. Some have treatments to control symptoms. Some are life-threatening."
What is (are) Frostbite ?,"Frostbite is an injury to the body that is caused by freezing. It most often affects the nose, ears, cheeks, chin, fingers, or toes. Frostbite can permanently damage the body, and severe cases can lead to amputation.    Signs of frostbite include       - A white or grayish-yellow skin area    - Skin that feels unusually firm or waxy    - Numbness       If you have symptoms of frostbite, seek medical care. But if immediate medical care isn't available, here are steps to take:       - Get into a warm room as soon as possible.    - Unless absolutely necessary, do not walk on frostbitten feet or toes. Walking increases the damage.    - Put the affected area in warm - not hot - water.    - You can also warm the affected area using body heat. For example, use your armpit to warm frostbitten fingers.     - Don't rub the frostbitten area with snow or massage it at all. This can cause more damage.     - Don't use a heating pad, heat lamp, or the heat of a stove, fireplace, or radiator for warming. Since frostbite makes an area numb, you could burn it.       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Rotavirus Infections ?,"Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. Symptoms include severe diarrhea, vomiting, fever, and dehydration. Almost all children in the U.S. are likely to be infected with rotavirus before their 5th birthday.    Infections happen most often in the winter and spring. It is very easy for children with the virus to spread it to other children and sometimes to adults. Once a child gets the virus, it takes about two days to become sick. Vomiting and diarrhea may last from three to eight days.    There is no medicine to treat it. To prevent dehydration, have your child drink plenty of liquids. Your health care provider may recommend oral rehydration drinks. Some children need to go to the hospital for IV fluids. Two vaccines against rotavirus infections are available.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Chest Injuries and Disorders ?,"The chest is the part of the body between your neck and your abdomen. It includes the ribs and breastbone. Inside your chest are several organs, including the heart, lungs, and esophagus. The pleura, a large thin sheet of tissue, lines the inside of the chest cavity.    Chest injuries and disorders include       - Heart diseases    - Lung diseases and collapsed lung    - Pleural disorders    - Esophagus disorders    - Broken ribs    - Thoracic aortic aneurysms    - Disorders of the mediastinum, the space between the lungs, breastbone, and spine"
What is (are) Migraine ?,"If you suffer from migraine headaches, you're not alone. About 12 percent of the U.S. population gets them. Migraines are recurring attacks of moderate to severe pain. The pain is throbbing or pulsing, and is often on one side of the head. During migraines, people are very sensitive to light and sound. They may also become nauseated and vomit.     Migraine is three times more common in women than in men. Some people can tell when they are about to have a migraine because they see flashing lights or zigzag lines or they temporarily lose their vision.     Many things can trigger a migraine. These include        -  Anxiety    -  Stress    -  Lack of food or sleep     -  Exposure to light    -  Hormonal changes (in women)       Doctors used to believe migraines were linked to the opening and narrowing of blood vessels in the head. Now they believe the cause is related to genes that control the activity of some brain cells. Medicines can help prevent migraine attacks or help relieve symptoms of attacks when they happen. For many people, treatments to relieve stress can also help.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"
Do you have information about Kidney Transplantation,"A kidney transplant is an operation that places a healthy kidney in your body. The transplanted kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis.     During a transplant, the surgeon places the new kidney in your lower abdomen and connects the artery and vein of the new kidney to your artery and vein. Often, the new kidney will start making urine as soon as your blood starts flowing through it. But sometimes it takes a few weeks to start working.     Many transplanted kidneys come from donors who have died. Some come from a living family member. The wait for a new kidney can be long.    If you have a transplant, you must take drugs for the rest of your life, to keep your body from rejecting the new kidney.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
Do you have information about Molds,"Molds are fungi that can be found both outdoors and indoors. They grow best in warm, damp and humid conditions. If you have damp or wet spots in your house, you will probably get mold.    Molds can cause health problems. Inhaling or touching mold or mold spores may cause allergic reactions or asthma attacks in sensitive people. Molds can cause fungal infections. In addition, mold exposure may irritate your eyes, skin, nose, throat, and lungs.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
Do you have information about Artificial Limbs,"People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones include       - Circulation problems from atherosclerosis or diabetes. They may cause you to need an amputation.    - Traumatic injuries, including from traffic accidents and military combat    - Cancer    - Birth defects       If you are missing an arm or leg, an artificial limb can sometimes replace it. The device, which is called a prosthesis, can help you to perform daily activities such as walking, eating, or dressing. Some artificial limbs let you function nearly as well as before."
Do you have information about Pacemakers and Implantable Defibrillators,"An arrhythmia is any disorder of your heart rate or rhythm. It means that your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Most arrhythmias result from problems in the electrical system of the heart. If your arrhythmia is serious, you may need a cardiac pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.    A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart.    An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms, it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias, especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat. This can help the doctor plan future treatment.    Getting a pacemaker or ICD requires minor surgery. You usually need to stay in the hospital for a day or two, so your doctor can make sure that the device is working well. You will probably be back to your normal activities within a few days."
What is (are) Bipolar Disorder ?,"Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it go through unusual mood changes. They go from very happy, ""up,"" and active to very sad and hopeless, ""down,"" and inactive, and then back again. They often have normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression.    The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families. Abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role.    Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. But children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.    If you think you may have it, tell your health care provider. A medical checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.    If not treated, bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide. However, there are effective treatments to control symptoms: medicine and talk therapy. A combination usually works best.    NIH: National Institute of Mental Health"
What is (are) Premenstrual Syndrome ?,"Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a group of symptoms that start one to two weeks before your period. Most women have at least some symptoms of PMS, and the symptoms go away after their periods start. For some women, the symptoms are severe enough to interfere with their lives. They have a type of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD.    Common PMS symptoms include       - Breast swelling and tenderness     - Acne    - Bloating and weight gain    - Pain - headache or joint pain    - Food cravings     - Irritability, mood swings, crying spells, depression        No one knows what causes PMS, but hormonal changes trigger the symptoms. No single PMS treatment works for everyone. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, aspirin or naproxen may help ease cramps, headaches, backaches and breast tenderness. Exercising, getting enough sleep, and avoiding salt, caffeine, and alcohol can also help.    Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health"
What is (are) Herniated Disk ?,"Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age, the disks break down or degenerate. As they do, they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.    A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak, irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.    Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and, sometimes, imaging tests. With treatment, most people recover. Treatments include rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"
Do you have information about Healthy Aging,"People in the U.S. are living longer than ever before. Many seniors live active and healthy lives. But there's no getting around one thing: as we age, our bodies and minds change. There are things you can do to stay healthy and active as you age:       - Eat a balanced diet    - Keep your mind and body active    - Don't smoke    - Get regular checkups    - Practice safety habits to avoid accidents and prevent falls       NIH: National Institute on Aging"
What is (are) Tetanus ?,"Tetanus is a serious illness caused by Clostridium bacteria. The bacteria live in soil, saliva, dust, and manure. The bacteria can enter the body through a deep cut, like those you might get from stepping on a nail, or through a burn.    The infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to ""locking"" of the jaw. This makes it impossible to open your mouth or swallow. Tetanus is a medical emergency. You need to get treatment in a hospital.    A vaccine can prevent tetanus. It is given as a part of routine childhood immunization. Adults should get a tetanus shot, or booster, every 10 years. If you get a bad cut or burn, see your doctor - you may need a booster. Immediate and proper wound care can prevent tetanus infection."
What is (are) Eyelid Disorders ?,"Your eyelids help protect your eyes. When you blink, your eyelids spread moisture over your eyes. Blinking also helps move dirt or other particles off the surface of the eye. You close your eyelids when you see something coming towards your eyes. This can help protect against injuries.    Like most other parts of your body, your eyelids can get infected, inflamed, or even develop cancer. There are also specific eyelid problems, including       - Eyelids that turn in or out    - Eyelids that droop    - Abnormal blinking or twitching       Treatment of eyelid problems depends on the cause."
Do you have information about Veterans and Military Health,"Military service members and veterans face some different health issues than civilians. During combat, the main health concerns are life-threatening injuries. These include       - Shrapnel and gunshot wounds    - Lost limbs    - Head and brain injuries       There may also be a risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards, such as contaminated water, chemicals, and infections.     Being in combat and being separated from your family can be stressful. The stress can put service members and veterans at risk for mental health problems. These include anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and substance abuse. Suicide can also be a concern."
What is (are) Scoliosis ?,"Scoliosis causes a sideways curve of your backbone, or spine. These curves are often S- or C-shaped. Scoliosis is most common in late childhood and the early teens, when children grow fast. Girls are more likely to have it than boys. It can run in families. Symptoms include leaning to one side and having uneven shoulders and hips.    Doctors use your medical and family history, a physical exam, and imaging tests to diagnose scoliosis. Treatment depends on your age, how much more you're likely to grow, how much curving there is, and whether the curve is temporary or permanent. People with mild scoliosis might only need checkups to see if the curve is getting worse. Others might need to wear a brace or have surgery.     NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases"
What is (are) Aneurysms ?,"An aneurysm is a bulge or ""ballooning"" in the wall of an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause dangerous bleeding or even death.     Most aneurysms occur in the aorta, the main artery that runs from the heart through the chest and abdomen. Aneurysms also can happen in arteries in the brain, heart and other parts of the body. If an aneurysm in the brain bursts, it causes a stroke.    Aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Often doctors can stop aneurysms from bursting if they find and treat them early. They use imaging tests to find aneurysms. Often aneurysms are found by chance during tests done for other reasons. Medicines and surgery are the two main treatments for aneurysms.     NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
What is (are) Chlamydia Infections ?,"Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted disease caused by bacteria. You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. Both men and women can get it.    Chlamydia usually doesn't cause symptoms. If it does, you might notice a burning feeling when you urinate or abnormal discharge from your vagina or penis.    In both men and women, chlamydia can infect the urinary tract. In women, infection of the reproductive system can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause infertility or serious problems with pregnancy. Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. In men, chlamydia can infect the epididymis, the tube that carries sperm. This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.    A lab test can tell if you have chlamydia. Antibiotics will cure the infection. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. Experts recommend that sexually active women 25 and younger get a chlamydia test every year.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"
Do you have information about Farm Health and Safety,"You might think of farms as peaceful settings. Actually, farming is one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. Farms have many health and safety hazards, including       - Chemicals and pesticides    - Machinery, tools and equipment that can be dangerous    - Hazardous areas, such as grain bins, silos and wells    - Livestock that can spread diseases or cause injuries       Farming injuries are very common. Physical labor and accidents can cause injuries.     Most farm accidents involve machinery. Proper machine inspection and maintenance can help prevent accidents. Using safety gloves, goggles and other protective equipment can also reduce accidents.     Occupational Safety and Health Administration"
Do you have information about Limb Loss,"People can lose all or part of an arm or leg for a number of reasons. Common ones include       - Problems with blood circulation. These may be the result of atherosclerosis or diabetes. Severe cases may result in amputation.    - Injuries, including from traffic accidents and military combat    - Cancer    - Birth defects       Some amputees have phantom pain, which is the feeling of pain in the missing limb. Other physical problems include surgical complications and skin problems, if you wear an artificial limb. Many amputees use an artificial limb. Learning how to use it takes time. Physical therapy can help you adapt.    Recovery from the loss of a limb can be hard. Sadness, anger, and frustration are common. If you are having a tough time, talk to your doctor. Treatment with medicine or counseling can help."
What is (are) Anemia ?,"If you have anemia, your blood does not carry enough oxygen to the rest of your body. The most common cause of anemia is not having enough iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that gives the red color to blood. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.    Anemia has three main causes: blood loss, lack of red blood cell production, and high rates of red blood cell destruction.    Conditions that may lead to anemia include       - Heavy periods    - Pregnancy    - Ulcers    - Colon polyps or colon cancer    - Inherited disorders    - A diet that does not have enough iron, folic acid or vitamin B12    - Blood disorders such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia, or cancer    - Aplastic anemia, a condition that can be inherited or acquired    - G6PD deficiency, a metabolic disorder       Anemia can make you feel tired, cold, dizzy, and irritable. You may be short of breath or have a headache.    Your doctor will diagnose anemia with a physical exam and blood tests. Treatment depends on the kind of anemia you have.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
What is (are) Transient Ischemic Attack ?,"A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a stroke that comes and goes quickly. It happens when the blood supply to part of the brain stops briefly. Symptoms of a TIA are like other stroke symptoms, but do not last as long. They happen suddenly, and include        - Numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body    - Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech    - Trouble seeing in one or both eyes    - Loss of balance or coordination       Most symptoms of a TIA disappear within an hour, although they may last for up to 24 hours. Because you cannot tell if these symptoms are from a TIA or a stroke, you should get to the hospital quickly.     TIAs are often a warning sign for future strokes. Taking medicine, such as blood thinners, may reduce your risk of a stroke. Your doctor might also recommend surgery.     NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"
What is (are) Tick Bites ?,"If you spend time outdoors or have pets that go outdoors, you need to beware of ticks. Ticks are small bloodsucking parasites. Many species transmit diseases to animals and people. Some of the diseases you can get from a tick bite are Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and tularemia.     Some ticks are so small that they can be difficult to see. Ticks may get on you if you walk through areas where they live, such as tall grass, leaf litter or shrubs.     Tick-borne diseases occur worldwide, including in your own backyard. To help protect yourself and your family, you should       -  Use a chemical repellent with DEET, permethrin or picaridin    -  Wear light-colored protective clothing     -  Tuck pant legs into socks     -  Avoid tick-infested areas     -  Check yourself, your children and your pets daily for ticks and carefully remove any ticks you find"
What is (are) Mild Cognitive Impairment ?,"Some forgetfulness can be a normal part of aging. However, some people have more memory problems than other people their age. This condition is called mild cognitive impairment, or MCI. People with MCI can take care of themselves and do their normal activities.    MCI memory problems may include       - Losing things often    - Forgetting to go to events and appointments    - Having more trouble coming up with words than other people of the same age       Memory problems can also have other causes, including certain medicines and diseases that affect the blood vessels that supply the brain. Some of the problems brought on by these conditions can be managed or reversed.    Your health care provider can do thinking, memory, and language tests to see if you have MCI. You may also need to see a specialist for more tests. Because MCI may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease, it's really important to see your health care provider every 6 to 12 months.    At this time, there is no proven drug treatment for MCI. Your health care provider can check to see if you have any changes in your memory or thinking skills over time.    NIH: National Institute on Aging"
What is (are) Genital Herpes ?,"Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can cause sores on your genital or rectal area, buttocks, and thighs. You can get it from having sex, even oral sex. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.    Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks. You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.    Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less often and the symptoms become milder. The virus stays in your body for life.    Medicines do not cure genital herpes, but they can help your body fight the virus. This can help lessen symptoms, decrease outbreaks, and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"
What is (are) Cholera ?,"Cholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food contaminated by feces (poop). Cholera is rare in the US. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with inadequate water treatment and poor sanitation, and lack of sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another.      Often the infection is mild or without symptoms, but sometimes it can be severe. Severe symptoms include profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In severe cases, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours.      Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment includes replacing fluid and salts and sometimes antibiotics.      Anyone who thinks they may have cholera should seek medical attention immediately. Dehydration can be rapid so fluid replacement is essential.     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Addison Disease ?,"Your adrenal glands are just above your kidneys. The outside layer of these glands makes hormones that help your body respond to stress and regulate your blood pressure and water and salt balance. Addison disease happens if the adrenal glands don't make enough of these hormones.    A problem with your immune system usually causes Addison disease. The immune system mistakenly attacks your own tissues, damaging your adrenal glands. Other causes include infections and cancer.    Symptoms include       - Weight loss     - Muscle weakness     - Fatigue that gets worse over time     - Low blood pressure     - Patchy or dark skin        Lab tests can confirm that you have Addison disease. If you don't treat it, it can be fatal. You will need to take hormone pills for the rest of your life. If you have Addison disease, you should carry an emergency ID. It should say that you have the disease, list your medicines and say how much you need in an emergency.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
What is (are) Kawasaki Disease ?,"Kawasaki disease is a rare childhood disease. It makes the walls of the blood vessels in the body become inflamed. It can affect any type of blood vessel, including the arteries, veins, and capillaries.    No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease. Symptoms include       -  High fever that lasts longer than 5 days    - Swollen lymph nodes in the neck    - A rash on the mid-section and genital area    - Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue    - Red, swollen palms of the hands and soles of the feet    - Redness of the eyes        Kawasaki disease can't be passed from one child to another. There is no single test. To diagnose it, doctors look at the signs and symptoms. They may also use an echocardiogram or other tests. It is mainly treated with medicines. Rarely, medical procedures and surgery also may be used for children whose coronary arteries are affected.     Kawasaki disease can't be prevented. However, most children who develop the disease fully recover - usually within weeks of getting signs and symptoms. Further problems are rare.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
Do you have information about HIV/AIDS Medicines,"In the early 1980s, when the HIV/AIDS epidemic began, patients rarely lived longer than a few years. But today, there are many effective medicines to fight the infection, and people with HIV have longer, healthier lives.    There are five major types of medicines:       - Reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitors - interfere with a critical step during the HIV life cycle and keep the virus from making copies of itself    - Protease inhibitors - interfere with a protein that HIV uses to make infectious viral particles    - Fusion inhibitors - block the virus from entering the body's cells    - Integrase inhibitors - block an enzyme HIV needs to make copies of itself    - Multidrug combinations - combine two or more different types of drugs into one       These medicines help people with HIV, but they are not perfect. They do not cure HIV/AIDS. People with HIV infection still have the virus in their bodies. They can still spread HIV to others through unprotected sex and needle sharing, even when they are taking their medicines.    NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"
What is (are) Fragile X Syndrome ?,"Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited developmental disability. A problem with a specific gene causes the disease. Normally, the gene makes a protein you need for brain development. But the problem causes a person to make little or none of the protein. This causes the symptoms of Fragile X.     People with only a small change in the gene might not show any signs of Fragile X. People with bigger changes can have severe symptoms. These might include       - Intelligence problems, ranging from learning disabilities to severe intellectual disabilities    - Social and emotional problems, such as aggression in boys or shyness in girls    - Speech and language problems, especially in boys       A genetic blood test can diagnose Fragile X. There is no cure. You can treat some symptoms with educational, behavioral, or physical therapy, and with medicines. Getting treatment early can help.    NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development"
Do you have information about Carbohydrates,"Carbohydrates are one of the main types of nutrients. They are the most important source of energy for your body. Your digestive system changes carbohydrates into glucose (blood sugar). Your body uses this sugar for energy for your cells, tissues and organs. It stores any extra sugar in your liver and muscles for when it is needed.    Carbohydrates are called simple or complex, depending on their chemical structure. Simple carbohydrates include sugars found naturally in foods such as fruits, vegetables, milk, and milk products. They also include sugars added during food processing and refining. Complex carbohydrates include whole grain breads and cereals, starchy vegetables and legumes. Many of the complex carbohydrates are good sources of fiber.    For a healthy diet, limit the amount of added sugar that you eat and choose whole grains over refined grains."
What is (are) Thoracic Outlet Syndrome ?,"Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) causes pain in the shoulder, arm, and neck. It happens when the nerves or blood vessels just below your neck are compressed, or squeezed. The compression can happen between the muscles of your neck and shoulder or between the first rib and collarbone. You may feel burning, tingling, and numbness along your arm, hand, and fingers. If a nerve is compressed, you may also feel weakness in your hand. If a vein is compressed, your hand might be sensitive to cold, or turn pale or bluish. Your arm might swell and tire easily.    TOS is more common in women. It usually starts between 20 and 50 years of age. Doctors do nerve and imaging studies to diagnose it.    There are many causes of TOS, including       - Injury    - Anatomical defects    - Tumors that press on nerves    - Poor posture that causes nerve compression    - Pregnancy    - Repetitive arm and shoulder movements and activity, such as from playing certain sports       Treatment depends on what caused your TOS. Medicines, physical therapy, and relaxation might help. Surgery may also be an option. Most people recover.    NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"
What is (are) Heat Illness ?,"Your body normally cools itself by sweating. During hot weather, especially with high humidity, sweating just isn't enough. Your body temperature can rise to dangerous levels and you can develop a heat illness. Most heat illnesses occur from staying out in the heat too long. Exercising too much for your age and physical condition are also factors. Older adults, young children and those who are sick or overweight are most at risk. Drinking fluids to prevent dehydration, replenishing salt and minerals, and limiting time in the heat can help.    Heat-related illnesses include       -  Heatstroke - a life-threatening illness in which body temperature may rise above 106 F in minutes; symptoms include dry skin, rapid, strong pulse and dizziness     -  Heat exhaustion - an illness that can precede heatstroke; symptoms include heavy sweating, rapid breathing and a fast, weak pulse     -  Heat cramps - muscle pains or spasms that happen during heavy exercise     -  Heat rash - skin irritation from excessive sweating        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"
What is (are) Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome ?,"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited disorders that weaken connective tissues. Connective tissues are proteins that support skin, bones, blood vessels, and other organs.     EDS usually affects your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Symptoms include       -  Loose joints     -  Fragile, small blood vessels     -  Abnormal scar formation and wound healing     -  Soft, velvety, stretchy skin that bruises easily        There are several types of EDS. They can range from mild to life-threatening. About 1 in 5,000 people has EDS. There is no cure. Treatment involves managing symptoms, often with medicines and physical therapy. It also includes learning how to protect your joints and prevent injuries."
What is (are) Gallstones ?,"Your gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ under your liver. It stores bile, a fluid made by your liver to digest fat. As your stomach and intestines digest food, your gallbladder releases bile through a tube called the common bile duct. The duct connects your gallbladder and liver to your small intestine.    Your gallbladder is most likely to give you trouble if something blocks the flow of bile through the bile ducts. That is usually a gallstone. Gallstones form when substances in bile harden. Gallstone attacks usually happen after you eat. Signs of a gallstone attack may include nausea, vomiting, or pain in the abdomen, back, or just under the right arm.    Gallstones are most common among older adults, women, overweight people, Native Americans and Mexican Americans.    Gallstones are often found during imaging tests for other health conditions. If you do not have symptoms, you usually do not need treatment. The most common treatment is removal of the gallbladder. Fortunately, you can live without a gallbladder. Bile has other ways to reach your small intestine.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
Do you have information about Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Health,"Every racial or ethnic group has specific health concerns. Differences in the health of groups can result from:       - Genetics    - Environmental factors    - Access to care    - Cultural factors       On this page, you'll find links to health issues that affect Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders."
What is (are) Esophagus Disorders ?,"The esophagus is the tube that carries food, liquids and saliva from your mouth to the stomach. You may not be aware of your esophagus until you swallow something too large, too hot or too cold. You may also become aware of it when something is wrong.     The most common problem with the esophagus is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It happens when a band of muscle at the end of your esophagus does not close properly. This allows stomach contents to leak back, or reflux, into the esophagus and irritate it. Over time, GERD can cause damage to the esophagus. Other problems include heartburn and cancer.    Treatment depends on the problem. Some get better with over-the-counter medicines or changes in diet. Others may need prescription medicines or surgery."
Do you have information about Toddler Development,"Mastering new skills such as how to walk, talk, and use the potty are developmental milestones. It is exciting to watch your toddler learn new skills. The normal development of children aged 1-3 can be broken down into the following areas:       - Gross motor - walking, running, climbing    - Fine motor - feeding themselves, drawing    - Sensory - seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, and smelling    - Language - saying single words, then sentences    - Social - playing with others, taking turns, doing fantasy play       Toddlers do not develop at the same rate. There is a wide range of what is considered ""normal."" Your child may be ahead in some areas and slightly behind in others. If you are worried about possible delays, talk to your child's health care provider."
What is (are) Sleep Apnea ?,"Sleep apnea is a common disorder that causes your breathing to stop or get very shallow. Breathing pauses can last from a few seconds to minutes. They may occur 30 times or more an hour.    The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.    You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways. Children with enlarged tonsils may also get it.    Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.    When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"
Do you have information about School Health,"Your child spends more time at school than anywhere else except home. Schools can have a major effect on children's health. Schools can teach children about health, and promote healthy behaviors. Physical education classes give children a chance to get exercise.    Schools work to       - Prevent risky behaviors such as alcohol and tobacco use, or bullying    - Encourage healthy habits like exercise and healthy eating    - Deal with specific health problems in students, such as asthma, obesity and infectious diseases       The school building and environment should be a safe and healthy place for your child."
What is (are) Managed Care ?,"Managed care plans are a type of health insurance. They have contracts with health care providers and medical facilities to provide care for members at reduced costs. These providers make up the plan's network. How much of your care the plan will pay for depends on the network's rules.    Plans that restrict your choices usually cost you less. If you want a flexible plan, it will probably cost more. There are three types of managed care plans:       - Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) usually only pay for care within the network. You choose a primary care doctor who coordinates most of your care.    - Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO) usually pay more if you get care within the network. They still pay part of the cost if you go outside the network.    - Point of Service (POS) plans let you choose between an HMO or a PPO each time you need care."
Do you have information about Underage Drinking,"Alcohol is the most widely abused substance among America's youth. Drinking by young people has big health and safety risks. It is dangerous because it       - Causes many deaths and injuries    - Can lead to poor decisions about engaging in risky behavior, such as drinking and driving or unprotected sex    - Increases the risk of physical and sexual assault    - Can lead to other problems, such as trouble in school    - May interfere with brain development    - Increases the risk of alcohol problems later in life       Kids often begin drinking to look ""cool"" or fit in with their peers. Parents can help their kids avoid alcohol problems. Open communication and conversations about drinking are important. So is being involved in your child's life. Get help for your child if you suspect a drinking problem.    NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism"
What is (are) Bladder Diseases ?,"The bladder is a hollow organ in your lower abdomen that stores urine. Many conditions can affect your bladder. Some common ones are       - Cystitis - inflammation of the bladder, often from an infection    - Urinary incontinence - loss of bladder control    - Overactive bladder - a condition in which the bladder squeezes urine out at the wrong time    - Interstitial cystitis - a chronic problem that causes bladder pain and frequent, urgent urination    - Bladder cancer       Doctors diagnose bladder diseases using different tests. These include urine tests, x-rays, and an examination of the bladder wall with a scope called a cystoscope. Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. It may include medicines and, in severe cases, surgery.     NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
Do you have information about International Health,"The spread of a disease doesn't stop at a country's borders. With more people traveling to other countries and living in crowded cities, it's easier for germs to spread. Infectious diseases that start in one part of the world can quickly reach another. Drug resistance is on the rise, making it harder to treat certain diseases. Natural and man-made disasters create refugee populations with immediate and long-term health problems.    Some of the major diseases currently affecting countries around the globe include HIV/AIDS, malaria, pandemic/avian flu, and tuberculosis. Many countries and health organizations are working together and sharing information on these and other health issues."
What is (are) Cushing's Syndrome ?,"Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder. The cause is long-term exposure to too much cortisol, a hormone that your adrenal gland makes. Sometimes, taking synthetic hormone medicine to treat an inflammatory disease leads to Cushing's. Some kinds of tumors produce a hormone that can cause your body to make too much cortisol.    Cushing's syndrome is rare. Some symptoms are       - Upper body obesity     - Thin arms and legs    - Severe fatigue and muscle weakness    - High blood pressure    - High blood sugar    - Easy bruising       Lab tests can show if you have it and find the cause. Your treatment will depend on why you have too much cortisol. If it is because you have been taking synthetic hormones, a lower dose may control your symptoms. If the cause is a tumor, surgery and other therapies may be needed.    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases"
What is (are) Infectious Arthritis ?,"Most kinds of arthritis cause pain and swelling in your joints. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. Infectious arthritis is an infection in the joint. The infection comes from a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that spreads from another part of the body. Symptoms of infectious arthritis include       - Intense pain in the joint    - Joint redness and swelling    - Chills and fever    - Inability to move the area with the infected joint       One type of infectious arthritis is reactive arthritis. The reaction is to an infection somewhere else in your body. The joint is usually the knee, ankle, or toe. Sometimes, reactive arthritis is set off by an infection in the bladder, or in the urethra, which carries urine out of the body. In women, an infection in the vagina can cause the reaction. For both men and women, it can start with bacteria passed on during sex. Another form of reactive arthritis starts with eating food or handling something that has bacteria on it.    To diagnose infectious arthritis, your health care provider may do tests of your blood, urine, and joint fluid. Treatment includes medicines and sometimes surgery."
What is (are) Jaundice ?,"Jaundice causes your skin and the whites of your eyes to turn yellow. Too much bilirubin causes jaundice. Bilirubin is a yellow chemical in hemoglobin, the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells. As red blood cells break down, your body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver. If the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down, bilirubin builds up in the body and your skin may look yellow.     Many healthy babies have some jaundice during the first week of life. It usually goes away. However, jaundice can happen at any age and may be a sign of a problem. Jaundice can happen for many reasons, such as       -  Blood diseases    -  Genetic syndromes    -  Liver diseases, such as hepatitis or cirrhosis    -  Blockage of bile ducts     -  Infections     -  Medicines"
What is (are) Urinary Tract Infections ?,"The urinary system is the body's drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. It includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the second most common type of infection in the body.    You may have a UTI if you notice       - Pain or burning when you urinate    - Fever, tiredness, or shakiness    - An urge to urinate often    - Pressure in your lower belly     - Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy or reddish    - Pain in your back or side below the ribs       People of any age or sex can get UTIs. But about four times as many women get UTIs as men. You're also at higher risk if you have diabetes, need a tube to drain your bladder, or have a spinal cord injury.    If you think you have a UTI it is important to see your doctor. Your doctor can tell if you have a UTI with a urine test. Treatment is with antibiotics.

What is (are) Male Breast Cancer ?,"Although breast cancer is much more common in women, men can get it too. It happens most often to men between the ages of 60 and 70.    Breast lumps usually aren't cancer. However, most men with breast cancer have lumps. Other breast symptoms can include       - Dimpled or puckered skin    - A red, scaly nipple or skin    - Fluid discharge       Risk factors for male breast cancer include exposure to radiation, a family history of breast cancer, and having high estrogen levels, which can happen with diseases like cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome.    Treatment for male breast cancer is usually a mastectomy, which is surgery to remove the breast. Other treatments include radiation, chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy.
